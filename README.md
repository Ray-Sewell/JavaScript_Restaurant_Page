# Project: Restaurant Page [JavaScript]

## Description

This project was done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s [JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript). The goal of the project is to produce a simple restaurant page. The purpose is to strengthen what was learnt during the original foundation course and provide further practise of DOM manipulation. This webpage is rendered fully using JavaScript utilising node package manager and webpack.
